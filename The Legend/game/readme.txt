Author's description:

I made these for my own use, because my other ones weren't smooth enough and none of my old sets matched my color scheme. Anyway, It's a set of dark gray, slightly beveled tailless arrows with a digital display sort of thing in the middle. The whole thing is animated because that's how I roll.
