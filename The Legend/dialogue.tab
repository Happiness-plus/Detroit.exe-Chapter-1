start_f633724a		Alexis and Marcus walk from campus, arguing about the dream. They continue walking up to the people mover; while there Marcus looks at his high school from above. 	game/script.rpy	386
start_09e8a8e0		The school is big as a university, holding only a max population of three thousand students.	game/script.rpy	388

start_2f526154	z	“What are your names?”	game/script.rpy	434
start_fd121dd7	a	“My name is Alexis Jackson, and this nutcase friend of mine is Marcus Webster.	game/script.rpy	435
start_53baa285	a	So, what were you talking about, God? He created all that is?”	game/script.rpy	436
start_6ec9911e	z	“In a sense, yes… I can substantiate my claim.”	game/script.rpy	437
start_5fa64006		Zion confidently brings out a dense old book from his black book bag.	game/script.rpy	438

start_39e0fef7	z	“In the beginning there was darkness, a void if you would imagine. Then God expanded his awareness 360 degrees.”	game/script.rpy	449
start_f77be8f1	a	“Zion, why did God do that?”	game/script.rpy	450
start_c8a48497	z	“Well…In physics, a void is basically no matter, therefore no energy.”	game/script.rpy	451
start_b632ee5a	z	“At the edge of His awareness, He spoke 'Let there be light!'”	game/script.rpy	453
start_5fabd252	a	“I am assuming that is where length, width, proportion, and depth were created.”	game/script.rpy	454
start_5386d441	m	“All I see is the Venn diagram, but call it whatever you like.”	game/script.rpy	455
start_1d363509	z	“The next day of creation, you have the Tripod of Life aka Borromean Rings. However, I like to call it the Holy Trinity. God created a firmament between the waters. Above it was called sky and below the oceans.”	game/script.rpy	456
start_d5b6fcd0	m	Is he serious?	game/script.rpy	458
start_7de4b990	m	I cannot tell if he is just trolling us or he actually believes in the crap he says.	game/script.rpy	460
start_01999ee2	z	“God puts lights in the firmament, to separate light from darkness and to mark days, seasons and years.”	game/script.rpy	461
start_d2ce28ee	a	“Interesting, I have learned that this is not a textbook, however a narrative.”	game/script.rpy	462
start_976cb116	m	A presumptuously sketchy narrative at best. I wonder what Alexis is thinking regarding all of this.	game/script.rpy	464
start_71e221d2	z	“One half of all of creation is completed.”	game/script.rpy	465
start_41735564	z	“God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called the Seas: and God saw that it was good.”	game/script.rpy	466
start_328926a1	z	“Moreover, God said, let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in it, upon the earth: and it was so.”	game/script.rpy	467
start_70ac4570	z	“And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in it, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.”	game/script.rpy	468
start_21c8507c	a	I do not know what to think about this. This is not how the Earth formed at all.	game/script.rpy	469
start_ba11fba3	m	For a homeless bum, why is he so clean?	game/script.rpy	470
start_cadb1892	m	Better yet, how is he so clean?	game/script.rpy	471
start_dc470ada	z	“God later created two lights in the sky; one is the moon to rule the stars. The other is the Sun to rule the day.”	game/script.rpy	472
start_11061e00		Zion summarizes as they walk down to the apartment.	game/script.rpy	473
start_714e6785	a	“God created the sun, moon, and the stars after all the plants?”	game/script.rpy	474
start_ca43183c	m	Huh... never thought about that.	game/script.rpy	476
start_38d72377	m	Go Alexis! Default skepticism at work.	game/script.rpy	478
start_743f1846	z	Yes he did.	game/script.rpy	479
start_1764d78c		Before Alexis counters Zion, Marcus pats her back.	game/script.rpy	480
start_a49570ad	m	There is a time and place for everything, especially argumentation.	game/script.rpy	482
start_3e64ae50	z	“What does you guys think? Heavenly Father said it; therefore, it is so.”	game/script.rpy	484
start_de08c4b2	a	“Home sweet home, guys”	game/script.rpy	487
start_0d81ce6d	z	“Woah, your place is fancy.”	game/script.rpy	488
start_d94d4d7b	z	“The apartment complex rotates?”	game/script.rpy	489
start_25bb5a9a	m	“Indeed, at 30 degrees per hour.”	game/script.rpy	490
start_e89b702e		Zion just stands all amazed at the apartment complex.	game/script.rpy	491
start_e7973deb	m	“Zion come in, already.”	game/script.rpy	492
start_6f6d7c9e	z	“Oh okay Marcus!”	game/script.rpy	493
start_9a60c6f4		The trio enters the building.	game/script.rpy	494
start_567e22b7	m	“This is where I live, over there is the MT”	game/script.rpy	499
start_ef7cb092	z	“So what is a MT?”	game/script.rpy	500
start_7b4d5104	a	“Stands for Matter Transporter”	game/script.rpy	501
start_178e5ceb	a	He's never heard of a MT before?	game/script.rpy	502
start_e1247395	a	Where is this guy from?	game/script.rpy	503
start_12475619		Zion slowly walks in one of the spots. Marcus and Alexis set the coordinates. The universe around Zion feels void, as he sees parts of his body fade away.	game/script.rpy	504
start_223f8487	z	“Why am I disintegrating? I feel sick... ”	game/script.rpy	505
start_a5f48666	m	“Relax!	game/script.rpy	507
start_d5c1ecff	m	It's science, we’re going to be safe.”	game/script.rpy	509
start_25419e0d	m	For a homeless person, he is quite sheltered....	game/script.rpy	510
start_5689fdf2		The trio dematerializes atom by atom, at the speed of light.	game/script.rpy	512
start_709367e1		Zion opens his eyes and looks the same as if nothing happened.	game/script.rpy	513
start_fa8cb232		They are in a stylish red hallway; Marcus finds his apartment 2 doors down from the MT, and there is a pad next to the door.	game/script.rpy	514
start_cfad4314		Marcus touches the pad and the door opens soundlessly.	game/script.rpy	515
start_a0546d1b	m	“Now let us get to the meaning of this meeting.”	game/script.rpy	518
start_b5ba6659	m	“Alexis, is that your music playing?”	game/script.rpy	520
start_8ab710e1	a	“I like it”	game/script.rpy	521
start_ac4ed6ec	a	“It’s a lot better than that stupid rap song.”	game/script.rpy	522
start_4f39115a	m	“Hey that rap song is awesome.”	game/script.rpy	523
start_709dda22	z	“What rap song?”	game/script.rpy	525
start_388f4e7b	a	“No Zion!”	game/script.rpy	526
start_95bbd244	m	“Computer, give me a beat.”	game/script.rpy	534
start_f5aefa0e	m	“I was getting my report card the other day and noticed something...”	game/script.rpy	540
start_f5e95289	m	“'Look at all those B’s on my report card' I said to myself.”	game/script.rpy	542
start_70344c16	m	“'This ain't right' I said.”	game/script.rpy	543
